# BUFFEROIL

Within this repository, can be found a simple pretext.html file
containing a minimalistic email template from the "IT Department."
To accompany this, is a Java .class file with a platform invoking
staged payload meant for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

# Usage

To successfully utilize this class, make sure you amend all
the necessary information pointed out in the comments to fit 
the situation. If a platform is intentionally not to be utilized
simply comment out that section and the relavent function before
moving on. 

Then, you will have to sign it. 

The commands will vary based on the installation environment, so 
syntax will be left to you. 

Once signed, make sure the payloads are publically accesible at the 
attack supplied links. 

Updated pretext.html, or any other HTMl file meant to run a .class

Wait... :D

# Credits

This code is nearly a copy from <ul>Advanced Penetration Testing<ul> 
by Will Alsopp. This book has become an invaluable resource, and provides
a fantastic theoretical framework from APT modeling that I intend to explore
further.
